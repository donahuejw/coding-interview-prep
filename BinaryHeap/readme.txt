The folder contains an implementation of a binary heap.  Elements to be inserted must either implement the Comparable interface or a Comparator must be supplied during construction of the heap so that the heap can determine the correct ordering between elements.  The exact sort order of the elements returned by remove() is ascending by default (i.e., each call returns the current minimum), or it can be explicitly specified by using the proper constructor to pass in an instance of the HeapOrder enum
