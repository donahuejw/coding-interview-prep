One of my recent technical screens involved implementing some operations for an UnrolledLinkedList (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrolled_linked_list).  That was my first significant exposure to this data structure, so afterward I decided to come home and work on implementing the same operations outside the context of an interview.

This implementation splits a node in half, creating a new LinkedList node for half the elements, whenever it's detected as full during an add operation.  A future change will be to have it proactively split a node when an add() operation results in the node reaching max capacity.  Ultimately I intend to have this data structure implement the full java.util.List interface, but it's still a work in progress.
