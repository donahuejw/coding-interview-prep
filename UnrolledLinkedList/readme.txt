One of my recent technical screens involved implementing some operations for an UnrolledLinkedList (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrolled_linked_list).  That was my first significant exposure to this data structure, so afterward I decided to come home and work on implementing the same operations outside the context of an interview.

For the moment this is an incomplete, and somewhat simplified, implementation in that it doesn't handle removes and it always adds new nodes when an insert is attempted into an existing node at an already occupied index rather than the more typical approach of only adding a new node when the appropriate existing node is at least half filled.  This avoids having to shift elements within a node.
